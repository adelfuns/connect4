# Connect 4

An *AgentSpeak* implementation to play Connect4. This Agent will play using the minmax algorithm to search for the next move. Once the minmax algorithm is completed it will be upgraded with *Alpha-Beta* pruning. The agent is defined to play in a specific environment, so in a different medium the expected behavior is to not play, it would need adaptations.

## Definition

The Agent will play the classic game Connect 4 but with some variations. First variation, the players will be playing in an 8 row and 8 column board. The second variation is that the players will have 2 game modes, playing to win and playing to lose. Both players play the same game mode in a match.

### Play to win



### Play to lose



### Heuristic function



### Alpha-Beta pruning [to confirm]



## Implementation

The program runs in [JASON](http://jason.sourceforge.net/). To run it you will need to download, instructions to run a program are in the page.

## Disclaimer

The board in which the Agent play is not our creation.
